        Features:
            - Displays a counter for total hits taken in the run under HUD stats.
            - Does not track self damage (e.g. blood donation, curse room...)
            - Icon changes based on the number of hits taken.

            ★★★ Hardcore Mode ★★★

            - You only got limited hits, you ran out, you die. (true death)
            - The number will now display amount of your remaining hits.
            - Giga Bomb explodes with Metal Pipe Drop sound when you die. (Volume warning)
            - Rewind your death will crash your game !
            - Get +1 hit reward when you clear a floor without a hit ! (Can be turned off)


        Configurables (Needs ModConfigMenu Mod !!):
            - Hardcore on or off. (default off)
            - Max hits you got in Hardcore Mode.
            - HUD position can be moved freely.
            - and more.


        Compatibility:
            - Repentance +, Repentance, haven't tested with other DLC.
            - REPENTOGON mod, Planetarium Chance mod
            - Should be compatible with other mods that do not modify the HUD.


        TO-DO:
            - Should I also take broken Holy Mantle into account ? :)
            - ...

        This is my first mod, so please be gentle with feedback. I hope you find it useful!

        Special thanks to @Peachee, whose Planetarium Chance mod served as a great reference.And to @- coolpew -, whose Giga-Explode on (True) Death mod gave me some inspiration on death effects.
